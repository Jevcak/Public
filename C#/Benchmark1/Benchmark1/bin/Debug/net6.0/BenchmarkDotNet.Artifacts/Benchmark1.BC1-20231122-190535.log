// Validating benchmarks:
// Benchmark BC1.Jedna: DefaultJob
//    * Benchmarked method `Jedna` is static. Benchmarks MUST be instance methods, static methods are not supported.

//    * Assembly Benchmark1 which defines benchmarks is non-optimized
Benchmark was built without optimization enabled (most probably a DEBUG configuration). Please, build it in RELEASE.
